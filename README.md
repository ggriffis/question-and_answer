This app will allow you to track questions with single updates.  You can view questions as an anonymous user.  In order
to create, update, or delete, questions and their accompanying answers, you must sign up as a user and sign in.  The
app will track which questions you create or update.  This app demonstrates the has_many through association type.  A user has many questions through authorships and a question has many users through authorships.  Each authorship is tracking not only which user and question it is associated with but the timestamp of when it was created. This way, you can track when each question/answer was updated and by whom.
